#Everyone’s a whore, Grace. We just sell different parts of ourselves.#Are you a whore? Because if you’re not, you’re in the wrong place.#The one minute. The soldier’s minute. In a battle, that’s all you get. One minute of everything at once. And anything before is nothing. Everything after, nothing. Nothing in comparison to that one minute.#I can charm dogs. Gypsy witchcraft. And those I can’t charm I can kill with my own hands.#You know, gentlemen, there is hell, and there is another place below hell.#Today, it will be me dead or you. But whoever it is, he’ll wake up in hell tomorrow.#She loves me. She told me. She loves me. And all you got was a bullet and a fucking wolf head cane.#The only way to guarantee peace is by making the prospect of war seem hopeless.#If you apologize once, you do it again and again and again. Like taking bricks out of the wall of your fucking house.#Those of you who are last will soon be first. And those of you who are downtrodden will rise up.#I’m not a traitor to my class. I am just an extreme example of what a working man can achieve.#I don’t pay for suits. My suits are on the house or the house burns down.#She’s in the past. The past is not my concern. The future is no longer my concern, either.#In France I got used to seeing men die. I never got used to seeing horses die.#Whiskey is good proofing water. It tells you who’s real and who isn’t.#I have made arrangements with men I trust. If I should die, then you will die, know that.#Fortune drops something valuable into your lap, you don’t just dump it on the bank of the cut.#Five for peace, two for truce, one abstention. Let’s get on with the war.#In pubs sometimes people say things and sometimes it’s the whisky talking. It’s hard to tell which is which.#I imagine being shot by a woman hurts the same as being shot by a man. Just a bit more shameful.#All religion is a foolish answer to a foolish question.#It’s not a good idea to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.#Get yourself a decent haircut, man. We’re going to the races.#Lies travel faster than the truth.#When you plan something well there’s no need to rush.#If you’re soft on rebellion, it’ll grow.#Good taste is for people who can’t afford sapphires.#A good man needs to hold out sometimes.#You have to get what you want your own way.#It’s business, Grace. And bad, bad business it is, all round. And I’m scared, Grace. I’m scared for you. I’m scared for the baby. And this is how I am when I’m scared. It is unfamiliar to you but not to me. I can fucking be scared and carry on. And it’s not pleasant to look at and no joy to be around.#There is no rest for me in this world. Perhaps in the next.#You can change what you do, but you can’t change what you want.#You don’t parley when you’re on the back foot.#You strike when your enemy is weak.#I know that you all want me to say that I’ll change, that this fucking business will change, but I’ve learnt something in the last few days. Those bastards. Those bastards are worse than us. Politicians, fucking judges, lords and ladies. They’re worse than us, and they will never admit us to their palaces, no matter how legitimate we become because of who we are.#No, I'm not God. Not yet.#Sometimes death is a kindness.#There is God and there are the Peaky Blinders#My name is Tommy Shelby and today i'm going to kill a man.#Already broken.#Oh, and there's a woman. Yeah. A woman. Who I love. And I got close. Nearly got fucking everything.#In the bleak midwinter.#We own the ropes, who's gonna hang us now, eh?#No fucking fighting!
